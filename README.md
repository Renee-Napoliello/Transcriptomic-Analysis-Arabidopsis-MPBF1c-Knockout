Analysis of transcriptomic dataset of an Arabidopsis thaliana Multi Protein Bridging Factor 1c knockdown

Multiprotein Bridging Factor 1c is an important transcriptional co-activator for genes related to heat stress in Arabidopsis. Suzuki, et. al conducted an  experiment using A. thaliana with this TF knocked out to examine differential transcription as compared to wild type in response to heat . They took transcriptomic analysis at 0, 20, and 60 minutes into the heat stress.

This is an anlysis of the dataset generated by the [Suzuki, et. al paper](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/21457365) titled "Identification of the MBF1 heat-response regulon of Arabidopsis thaliana."

The original dataset is avilable at [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MEXP-2760/Downloads) under the title "Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis thaliana Multiprotein Bridging Factor 1c knock out plants following heat stress"
